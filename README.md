SNHU C++/ Project Three
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  * The project I selected was Project Three, where we were tasked with creating an application for a grocery store which lists the frequency of items purchased within the store. I created a feature which reads files and writes into a new one, a menu with the ability to find items, list items, create a histogram of the items, and exit the program. 
  
2. What did you do particularly well?
  * In my opinion, I felt I did very well with the getInteger function. I created it so that user input had to be validated before the program went further. For example, only menu options 1-4 were accepted. No other numbers, letters, or characters were allowed.
  
3.  Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  * I absolutely think I could have made improvement to the findItem function. I believe I could have created a way to receive user input that are both lowercase and uppercase while still accessing the same item.
  
4.  Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  * I believe it was the most challenging to implement several files for this code, the header, and two .cpp files in a properly formatted way. I used my previous work from this course, specifically the banking app in Project Two. The project helped me understand how to improve for the grocery app in Project Three. It aided me in the understanding of keeping main.cpp a more clean file, which allowed me to take this into consideration and create a main file with very minimal code and only a run function.
  
5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  * Some skills I improved on after creating this assignment was better understanding the use of private and public member functions and how they are important. This is something that will be incredibly applicable to future projects and coursework as keeping certain members private will be necessary when working with other developers. 
  
6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  * I included in-line comments as well as used proper naming functions to easily identify which section of the code I was working on.
